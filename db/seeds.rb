    title: 'Burl Canyon Community Kitchen',
    content: 'An exercise in Aspirational Fiction

I’d been harvesting from kitchen gardens on the south side of Hidden Hill all morning. The hundreds of squats required for the task, the heat from a high noon sun, and the fact that I hadn’t eaten anything all day had me thinking of lunch. I made my way to a good stopping point then stood up and slapped the soil off of my hands. I grabbed the basket I’d been using to harvest and walked over to my bicycle. I situated the basket in the bike trailer and gave it a quick shake to make sure everything would remain secure for the ride. Wearing board shorts and a sleeveless shirt I hopped on the bike and with one hard shove I was moving. I began to coast down the hill headed towards the community kitchen. With a 5 minute ride ahead my mind began to wonder. I realized that I didn’t remember what was cooking for lunch.

Descending further down the hill the bike picked up speed. The midday sun ahead pierced through the leaves of oak branches hanging low above the path. I saw a group of neighbors about a hundred yards to my right working in dense vegetation. They must have been doing the hard work of pruning some of our food forests. I yelled to the group as loudly as I could announcing that I was headed to the kitchen. I saw someone turn and give me a thumbs up and although my glance was quick, it looked like it was my friend Luke.

I arrived at the community kitchen and sure enough a group was sitting at an outdoor table. A neighbor named Bill told me that there was a mushroom curry simmering inside, beside it was a loaf of acorn bread. He guessed that it would still be warm. Wasting no time, I grabbed the bike trailer full of late season tomatoes, broccolini, chard, and a basket of early season acorns my friend’s daughter Marley had gathered the day before. I pulled the trailer up to the back of the community kitchen and slapped the door a couple of times.

I shouted through the screen into the kitchen, “Looks like tomatoes are still on for at least another week. Also, Marley got us some more acorns. I’m leaving everything right here in the shade. You won’t forget, right?”

I was either misunderstood or ignored as I didn’t receive an answer to my question. Someone in the kitchen yelled back, “Keep bringing tomatoes for another few months.”

I laughed in return, “Not really up to me, but I’ll do what I can.”

I looked down at my hands and they were still covered in soil residue. I knew that someone would give me a hard time if I walked through the kitchen so I took the long way back around. I made my way up the steps to the patio and flipped open the screen door and headed inside. I again took a long route, this time on my way to the bowls as I first passed by the pot of curry. I spotted a wisp of steam rising up just before sweet and savory fragrances hit me in the nose. I rushed to the bowls to find the largest one. I spotted a brightly colored bowl that my nephew had made a few months back. We seem to share genetics that result in large appetites, his was the largest of them all. I returned to the simmering pot and ladled a richly dark curry and grabbed a slice of acorn bread.

“All right… still warm.”

My friend Celeste rushed around the bar top from the kitchen carrying a small bowl. She asked me if I’d like some fresh cilantro to top it off.

I bowed my head in gratitude and responded, “You know me so well.”

She looked down at my hands, “Goodness, your hands are filthy. One idea that you could have had is to wash them in the stream before you made your way inside. Make sure you don’t leave any of that behind, bub.”

Not finding anything to say in return I just apologized. In many ways Celeste was the backbone of the kitchen and while I loved her dearly, she seemed to have a way of making me nervous. I might even admit after a few ciders that sometimes she made me a bit scared.

Before I headed back outside I turned to chat with the rest of the people in the kitchen. I saw that Catalina had a smirk on her face, I guessed that it was from the exchange I just had with Celeste. She took a few steps towards me and leaned onto the bar to chat, “Hey we’re doing some more canning in a couple of days. Why don’t you come down and sit at the bar and keep us company?”

I laughed knowing that “sit at the bar and keep us company,” really meant enjoy a warm caffeinated drink at the bar for a few minutes before helping all day. But, I enjoyed helping the kitchen and everyone knew that, so I continued to play along. “As long as we have more of those incredible blackberry muffins that John made last week.”

Celeste lovingly slapped me on the back with her kitchen towel, “You know all too well how much work canning requires. If you want your muffins, I invite you to come down here well before sunrise and make them yourself. Just try not to make another mess like you did last time. Alright, bub?”

I looked down at my big bowl of curry and bread realizing how gluttonous I must have looked. I began to slowly walk backwards towards the door as I told them thanks for the curry and that I’d be there for the canning. I heard laughter as I turned my back to head through the door… always jokes in the kitchen.

I made my way towards the table full of neighbors that I had seen on my way in. I sat down beside my friend Bill and as I looked down the table to see who else was there I was surprised to see a new face. It wasn’t every week or even every month that I got to meet someone new. I quickly stood up and walked over to introduce myself and the newcomer did the same.

We both extended our hands as my neighbor Genshaw introduced us. “Lyla this is my neighbor August, August this is my cousin Lyla. She’s visiting us for a while. She and a couple of friends pedaled their bikes up here from a community called Las Piedras nearly a thousand miles to the south. Her two friends are still back at the house cleaning up. Should be here any minute.”

I smiled, “Happy to have you, Lyla. It’s nice to meet you, and I’m excited to hear about your journey. I tell people too often that there’s nothing like a good bicycle tour.”

Genshaw couldn’t help but heckle, “It’s true. He reminds me all of the time.”

Lyla laughed, “Well we’re staying for a while so I think we’ll find plenty of time to swap stories.”

I thought for a moment about the regions that Lyla had just travelled through and I knew that there must be some stories to tell. I looked at her once more as I began to sit down, “Really looking forward to that, Lyla.” I dipped a spoon into the bowl of curry as the table began to debate how to best show our guests around. It seemed like everyone had lots of opinions on the topic.

Genshaw soon interjected, “Hey, I’ll be busy this afternoon setting up a space for the adventurers to stay. Any of you wanna put your money where your mouth is and serve as an afternoon tour guide?”

My eyes rolled around as I thought about my to do list. I couldn’t think of anything that couldn’t be pushed off a day or two, so I chimed in, “I’d be happy to. Might even be enough sun today to conclude the tour with a swim at Cliff’s Bath.”

The table seemed to approve of the idea and Bill responded, “Yeah that needs to happen. I’ll head down there a couple of hours before sundown to try to meet up with you all. Afterwards we could come back here and grab some dinner. Lyla, we’ll run into a bunch of the neighborhood at that time of day. It’s my favorite time to be here.”

“I like that plan,” said Lyla.

As I scooped up the last bit of curry with the last bit of acorn bread, I heard a few bicycles riding up to the table. I glanced over and saw that it was Lyla’s two friends along with my friend Luke. They all dismounted and leaned their bikes up against some nearby trees and immediately remarked on the amazing smell.

“There’s a curry inside with your names on it,” I exclaimed, “By the way, what are your names?”

The young woman responded, “I’m Mary, pleased to meet you. And this is my husband Abayomi.”

The young man of African descent gave me a quick wave, “Nice to meet you. My name Abayomi means ‘bringer of happiness,’ but I’m still learning to live up to the namesake.”

I laughed, “Ha that is a lot of pressure. Well, don’t worry about that here, Abayomi. It’s nice to meet you both.”

Genshaw said they could head inside and get something to eat. We all insisted that they eat as much as they’d like as long as they were staying with us. Luke stood behind as our guests made their way inside. He turned to the table and told us that he’d seen two strangers slowly and casually riding their bikes down the hill towards the kitchen.

“They were taking their time, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells. I easily caught up and startled them when I said hello.” He laughed as he recounted the story. “After that we were fast friends,” he said, “I think that we’ll all enjoy their company while they’re here.”

Once everyone finished eating and after a period of “rest and digest,” our guests, Luke and myself saddled up our bicycles and headed back up the hill to begin the tour. I mentioned that whenever I showed visitors around I liked to kick things off by heading up to a nearby mountain for a view of the whole canyon. Luke expressed his approval with an enthusiastic “Yup,” knowing exactly the spot that I was referring to. As we started uphill I yelled behind, “Sorry to start off the tour by making you all work, but pretty much everything is uphill from the kitchen.”

With a surprisingly calm demeanor, Lyla responded, “Ha, don’t apologize. I can’t even believe how easy it is to pedal up this hill without all of that gear.” Luke and myself exchanged a quick glance as we huffed and puffed.

Luke turned back towards our guests and asked, “What’s it like where you are from? It’s called Las Piedras, right?”

I turned to Lyla and saw her demeanor change. With a more serious tone she responded, “Things in Las Piedras are complicated.” She paused before she continued, “It used to be a fertile and forested region. We used to export food but a few decades ago everything changed and now we can barely support the small fraction of the population that remains. Our elders talk of an old Las Piedras that was like the land of milk and honey, now it’s more like a barren wasteland.” She struggled to continue and I couldn’t tell if it was because she was pedaling at the same time or if she was frustrated by the story. “When things started to get bad, people started stealing food from one another and community trust went out the window. Our leadership became corrupt and efforts to regenerate were small and whenever progress was made they were quickly exploited. Now, most have moved elsewhere. It’s listed as an ecosystem crisis zone and we’re hoping that aid comes soon. The problem is that since our population is now so small, we’re low priority for help.“

Abayomi sensed Lyla’s distress and picked up where she had left off, “That’s why we’re here. We hope to learn as much as we can and hopefully return home with some ideas for how to turn things around. Our community came together to get us reliable bikes for our journey and enough food to get us through the few hundred miles of desert north of Las Piedras. After about a week of riding we entered a more vegetated country and we were offered food from locals. It’s amazing that people are so much more hospitable and kind in areas with healthier ecologies.”

It wasn’t much longer before we ditched our bikes at a trailhead and continued on foot. We hiked through a stand of Oak trees that were planted not long after the community kitchen was first formed. After just a few minutes the view opened up ahead and we could see an impressive rock outcrop overlooking the canyon. The rock stood maybe 30 feet tall and it was a type of sandstone with a relatively hard exterior. It had a lighter color which created a beautiful contrast amongst the vegetation that surrounded it. It was completely covered with small cavities that made it look as if the surface was once boiling and the bubbles all simultaneously popped. The cavities acted almost like rungs on a ladder making the rock easy to climb.

As Luke surveyed the rock outcrop he turned to me to ask “How about we take the easy way up for now? If our guests’s adventurous spirit extends to rock climbing, we could come back another time with some gear.”

I turned back towards the others and before I could say anything Lyla agreed, “Yeah let’s just get up there. But Luke, you let me know when you’re coming back to climb and I’ll climb with you.”

Luke smiled at Lyla, “That’s a deal! I’d climb tomorrow.”

We made our way around to the other side of the outcrop where a large crack had created a comfortably sloped route to the top with lots of hand and footholds. Luke took the lead and we scrambled our way to the top in single file. As he emerged ahead of us he exclaimed, “I don’t know of another spot so close to the kitchen where you can see both the Pacific and Lucia Range at the same time. I love coming up here.”

As the rest of us joined him, no one said anything as we scanned the view. Off in the distance we could just barely make out the figures of a few people moving around on the landscape.

Eventually I broke the silence, “It still amazes me that this community was even able to come together in the way that it did. I bet people from the early 2000s couldn’t even imagine the way that we live.” I turned to the group and asked. “Have you heard anything about the people that steward the kitchen itself?”

The group shook their heads, so I continued on, “There are five of our neighbors that make up our culinary dream team. They know just how to make everyone happy. First, there’s Adri who we affectionately refer to as the “curry master,” I believe you know why after today’s lunch. Then there’s Celeste who grew up in a family of French chefs, she’s also an incredible cheesemaker. But don’t make a mess in the kitchen, or you’ll soon be helping her. She might ask you to pull a trailer all over the hills with your bicycle delivering home food boxes. Then you’ll have to go all the way up to her house at the top of a big hill to drop off the trailer before you can head home yourself… It’s a long story.”

Luke chimed in, “Then there’s Leandro and Catalina. They’ll change the way that you think about tacos.”

The guests looked at each other, clearly excited about the idea of that.

I continued on, “Lastly there’s John, one of our elders who’s worked as our baker since he was just a boy in the early days of the Burl Canyon Community Kitchen. He’s an amazing person. When he has extra time he likes to bake something special and invite everyone to sit around and tell stories.”

“No one tells a story like John,” Luke added.

We all shared a natural moment of silence while we appreciated John, even though only Luke and myself knew him. It seemed that the idea of John alone was enough to elicit deep appreciation. That impressed me. John always impressed me. He always impressed everyone except for those who were jealous of him. It always bewildered me that John’s huge heart and amazing intellect had attracted so much drama. At least he was skilled at handling it. Seems likely that humans will always be a complex social species.

Lyla pointed down towards a clearing where she spotted a few people emerging from a forest with small pigs running around at their feet.

I began to explain, “Almost everyone in the community does something to tend to the animals and the landscape. We steward every last bit of the land, mostly cultivating food forests and row crops. We have a huge and ever expanding variety of edible plants. We also freely move animals all over. That was made possible when most of the fences between neighbors were taken down. The few that remain are simply too much work to remove and they serve as a valuable reminder of how separated we all used to be.”

No one spoke for a while. I contemplated what a relief it was to not be in a neighborhood of individuals who are so separate from and all completely responsible for their own livelihood.

“What an exhausting existence that must have been,” exclaimed Luke, indicating that we were thinking along the same lines.

Lyla scanned the visible landscape then asked, “Where does your community end and the next begin?”

Luke handled the response, “There aren’t any defined borders. There’s actually quite a bit of overlap with large areas that are jointly managed. Then there are other areas that don’t have much human activity at all. We try to collaborate as much as possible with others. It’s important because it always renews that sense that we are on the same team.”

I added, “Then there’s the Lucia Range which you can just barely see up to the right. There aren’t any human settlements up there but there’s usually a few ongoing projects that are managed jointly by several communities. It’s another way to collaborate with other people in the bioregion. Also, managing the higher elevations is important for the health of the lower elevation landscapes. The foraging and hunting up there also provides necessary back up food in challenging years when harvests may come up short. Next time you’re in the kitchen, look for the old photos on the wall of huge trees being hauled away with clear cuts in the background. Those were taken in Lucia Range and they bear no resemblance to the landscapes that you can see up there today.”

Luke picked up the story where I left off, “A lot of the projects that happen in Lucia Range and even within Burl Canyon are developed in collaborative bioregional scale permaculture designs that happen at the Bioregional Learning Center. We regularly send a handful of our people to the campus 45 miles south of here near where the Salinas River empties into the Pacific Ocean. It’s always fun to go there because we get to bring and share anything that we’ve been learning here in Burl Canyon, and we also get to hear what others have been learning too. We almost always return with things that we can apply here. Oh, and I have to mention the amazing new recipes that we get to enjoy that come out of the Bioregional Learning Center’s Food Lab.”

Luke then added, “Whenever a group returns from the BLC, we know an amazing dinner is coming.”

I turned to our guests, “Speaking of amazing dinners coming, you’ll still be here next week for a celebration of life. Did you all hear the sad news about the passing of one of our younger neighbors who was on deployment in an ecosystem crisis zone?”

Lyla mentioned that Genshaw had told her part of the story but that her friends hadn’t yet heard.

I continued, “Apparently it was in a region that had suffered from near total desertification and thousands of climate refugees were leaving the region. A large battalion of permaculture practitioners from all over the continent travelled there to help create a regional design. They had implemented water capture systems and started guiding ecosystems through early phases of succession. We heard about all sorts of amazing progress, food and water supplies for the region were beginning to stabilize. But just a month before their scheduled return home a group of climate refugees from another nearby region came into the village where the battalion was staying. The refugees had gone weeks in the desert without much food and as soon as they arrived, tensions were high. Fighting broke out and tragically some 40 people passed on, one of whom grew up right here in Burl Canyon.”

I stopped talking for a moment as we all stared off into the distance. No one said anything, so I continued, “So that’s why we’re holding the celebration of life. We invited a couple other neighboring communities to join us in remembrance. There will be a busy few days at the community kitchen as food will be prepared all day and night. Make sure that you’re all caught up on sleep before the festivities begin. With so many people in the neighborhood we’ll be able to assemble a lot of musicians. We’ll even be able to hear the music from up here. I was up here a month ago when several communities were in the canyon to join us in celebration of the Fall Equinox. On the third day of festivities I was so exhausted that I hiked up here with a couple of friends from other communities. I wanted to show them this spot and to watch from a distance. We sat right here as the sun set and a full moon rose. Music resonated throughout the canyon. A few songs after the sunset the music stopped and and the crowd followed with a roar of encore. From up here it was almost as if a pack of wolves was howling at the full moon. It sent chills down my spine. I plan to come back up here at some point during next week’s celebration. If you all want, I can try to find you to invite you along.”

“Yes please,” Lyla said.

“Great, we’ll have our own little celebration of life,” Luke said as his eyes continued to scan the landscapes below.'
